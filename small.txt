in xanadu did kubla khan 
a stately pleasuredome decree 
where alph the sacred river ran 
through caverns measureless to man 
   down to a sunless sea 
so twice five miles of fertile ground 
with walls and towers were girdled round 
and there were gardens bright with sinuous rills 
where blossomed many an incensebearing tree 
and here were forests ancient as the hills 
enfolding sunny spots of greenery 

but oh that deep romantic chasm which slanted 
down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover 
a savage place as holy and enchanted 
as eer beneath a waning moon was haunted 
by woman wailing for her demonlover 
and from this chasm with ceaseless turmoil seething 
as if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing 
a mighty fountain momently was forced 
amid whose swift halfintermitted burst 
huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail 
or chaffy grain beneath the threshers flail 
and mid these dancing rocks at once and ever 
it flung up momently the sacred river 
five miles meandering with a mazy motion 
through wood and dale the sacred river ran 
then reached the caverns measureless to man 
and sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean 
and mid this tumult kubla heard from far 
ancestral voices prophesying war 
   the shadow of the dome of pleasure 
   floated midway on the waves 
   where was heard the mingled measure 
   from the fountain and the caves 
it was a miracle of rare device 
a sunny pleasuredome with caves of ice 

   a damsel with a dulcimer 
   in a vision once i saw 
   it was an abyssinian maid 
   and on her dulcimer she played 
   singing of mount abora 
   could i revive within me 
   her symphony and song 
   to such a deep delight twould win me 
that with music loud and long 
i would build that dome in air 
that sunny dome those caves of ice 
and all who heard should see them there 
and all should cry beware beware 
his flashing eyes his floating hair 
weave a circle round him thrice 
and close your eyes with holy dread 
for he on honeydew hath fed 
and drunk the milk of paradise
